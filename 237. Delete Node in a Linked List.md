## 237. Delete Node in a Linked List

  Easy

  Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

  Given linked list -- head = [4,5,1,9], which looks like following:

  **Example 1:**

  ```
  Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
  Output: [4,1,9]
  Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.
  ```

  **Example 2:**

  ```
  Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1
  Output: [4,5,9]
  Explanation: You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.
  ```

### Python

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def deleteNode(self, node):
        """
        :type node: ListNode
        :rtype: void Do not return anything, modify node in-place instead.
        """
        node.val = node.next.val
        node.next = node.next.next
```
