## 151. Reverse Words in a String

Medium

Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.

**Example:**  

```
Input: "the sky is blue",
Output: "blue is sky the".
```

**Note:**

- A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
- Input string may contain leading or trailing spaces. However, your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
- You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.

### Java

````java
public class Solution {
    public String reverseWords(String s) {
        String[] words = s.trim().split(" +");
        Collections.reverse(Arrays.asList(words));
        return String.join(" ", words);
    }
}
````

### Python

````python
class Solution(object):
    def reverseWords(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        return " ".join(filter(lambda x: x is not '', s.strip().split(' ')[::-1]))
````
